## üìÇ Insomnia Requests
For greater convenience, an Insomnia file containing all the API requests has been created. This allows you to easily test the endpoints without having to manually configure each request. The file is named `InsomniaRequests.json` and is located in the root of the project.

To use this file, follow these steps
1. Open Insomnia.
2. Go to `Application` > `Preferences` > `Data` tab.
3. Click on `Import Data` and select `From File`.
4. Choose the `InsomniaRequests.json` file from the root of the project.
5. The requests will be imported and ready to use.


## üìö Usage Examples

Below are examples of how to use the Quick Form Fill Backend API endpoints in different scenarios. These examples can help you understand how to interact with the API effectively. By default, the application will run on `localhost:8080`.

- ### üÜï Create a Product
  - To create a new product, send a `POST` request to the `/products` endpoint with the product details in the request body. The request body should be in JSON format as shown below
    ```json
      {
        "name": "Wireless Mouse",
        "description": "A high-precision wireless mouse",
        "category": "Electronics",
        "price": 29.99,
        "amount": 150,
        "supplier": "TechSupplier Co.",
        "brand": "TechBrand"
      }
      ```

  - If the product is created successfully, the API will respond with a status code `201 Created` and the details of the newly created product in the response body
      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Wireless Mouse",
        "description": "A high-precision wireless mouse",
        "category": "Electronics",
        "price": 29.99,
        "amount": 150,
        "supplier": "TechSupplier Co.",
        "brand": "TechBrand"
      }
      ```

- ### üîç Retrieve a Product by ID
  - To retrieve details of a specific product by its ID, send a `GET` request to the `/products/{id}` endpoint, replacing `{id}` with the actual product ID.
    If the product with the specified ID exists, the API will respond with a status code `200 OK` and the details of the product in the response body

    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Wireless Mouse",
      "description": "A high-precision wireless mouse",
      "category": "Electronics",
      "price": 29.99,
      "amount": 150,
      "supplier": "TechSupplier Co.",
      "brand": "TechBrand"
    }
    ```

  - If the product with the specified ID, in this case `2`, is not found, the API will respond with a status code `404 Not Found` and an error message in the response body

    ```json
    {
      "status": 404,
      "timestamp": "2024-05-17T23:00:03-03:00",
      "type": "https://hopefood.com.br/product-not-found",
      "title": "Product not found",
      "detail": "Product not found with ID: 2"
    }
    ```
- ### üìÑ Retrieve All Products
  - To retrieve a list of all products, send a `GET` request to the `/products` endpoint.
  If the request is successful, the API will respond with a status code `200 OK` and an array of product details in the response body. For example

    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Wireless Mouse",
        "description": "A high-precision wireless mouse",
        "category": "Electronics",
        "price": 29.99,
        "amount": 150,
        "supplier": "TechSupplier Co.",
        "brand": "TechBrand"
      }
    ]
    ```
- ### ‚úèÔ∏è Update a Product
  - To update an existing product, send a PUT request to the `/products/{id}` endpoint with the updated product details in the request body. Replace `{id}` with the actual product ID. The request body should be in JSON format as shown below. 
  
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Ergonomic Wireless Mouse",
      "description": "An ergonomic wireless mouse with additional buttons",
      "category": "Electronics",
      "price": 39.99,
      "amount": 200,
      "supplier": "TechSupplier Co.",
      "brand": "TechBrand"
    }
    ```
    
  - If the product with the specified ID exists and is successfully updated, the API will respond with a status code `200 OK` and the updated details of the product in the response body

      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Ergonomic Wireless Mouse",
        "description": "An ergonomic wireless mouse with additional buttons",
        "category": "Electronics",
        "price": 39.99,
        "amount": 200,
        "supplier": "TechSupplier Co.",
        "brand": "TechBrand"
      }
    ```

  - If the product with the specified ID, in this case `2`, is not found, the API will respond with a status code `404 Not Found` and an error message in the response body

    ```json
    {
      "status": 404,
      "timestamp": "2024-05-17T23:00:03-03:00",
      "type": "https://hopefood.com.br/product-not-found",
      "title": "Product not found",
      "detail": "Product not found with ID: 2"
    }
    ```

- ### üóëÔ∏è Delete a Product
  - To delete an existing product, send a DELETE request to the `/products/{id}` endpoint. Replace `{id}` with the actual product ID you want to delete. If the product with the specified ID is successfully deleted, the API will respond with a status code `204 No Content` and no response body.

  - If the product with the specified ID, in this case `2`, is not found, the API will respond with a status code `404 Not Found` and an error message in the response body

    ```json
    {
      "status": 404,
      "timestamp": "2024-05-17T23:00:03-03:00",
      "type": "https://hopefood.com.br/product-not-found",
      "title": "Product not found",
      "detail": "Product not found with ID: 2"
    }
    ```
